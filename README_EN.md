## 📖 Project Introduction

This is an open-source e-commerce learning project built with ArkTS and ArkUI, aiming to
demonstrate how to use modern HarmonyOS development technologies to build a complete e-commerce
application. The project covers core flows such as user authentication, product display, shopping
cart, and order payment, suitable for developers to learn and reference modern HarmonyOS development
technologies.

As a technology-loving individual developer, I have invested more than half a year of my spare time
into this project. Every feature implementation and code optimization is the result of my careful
crafting during leisure time. Although the progress may not be as fast as a dedicated team, and some
feature implementations are not yet perfect, I will continue to improve and refine them. If you are
interested in HarmonyOS development, whether for learning or collaborative creation, you are welcome
to join.

## 🚀 Development Plan

This is an open-source project driven purely by personal passion. As a full-time developer, I can
only maintain it in my spare time, and every line of code embodies the effort I put in after work
and on weekends. Despite limited time, I still hope to build a complete e-commerce learning
example with this project. It is more suitable as a learning reference than a commercial product,
as some aspects have not yet reached commercial-grade standards. My goal is to provide other
developers with a hands-on platform for learning modern HarmonyOS development.

Due to time and energy constraints, the update pace may not be fast, but I will continue to invest
long-term and gradually improve each functional module. If you are interested in contributing,
whether in code, design, or documentation, you are very welcome!
